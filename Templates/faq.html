        <h2>1. What is the Skin Disease Detection System?</h2>
        <p>The Skin Disease Detection System uses machine learning models to classify skin lesions and identify different types of skin diseases. This system provides a web interface where users can get recommendations for skincare based on the skin condition they select. The model is trained using the HAM10000 dataset, which contains labeled images of various skin conditions, and the system offers advice based on these conditions.</p>
